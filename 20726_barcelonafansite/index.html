   		 <h2>Historical of FC Barcelona</h2>
   		 <p>The football section of FC Barcelona (whose official name in Catalan is Futbol Club Barcelona and short for Barça) is a Spanish football club founded in 1899, based in Barcelona and which plays its part in the Spanish football championship.

                Barça is the third European in the ranking of football clubs of the 20th century awarded by the IFFHS and the most successful European club of the 21st century2. He has won a total of twenty-six championships, thirty Spanish Cups, five Champions Leagues, four Cup Winners' Cups, three Fair Cities Cups and three Club World Cups.
                
                Originally established at the Stade des Corts, the Blaugranesnote 1 have been based since 1957 at Camp Nou (Catalan for “new stadium”), the largest stadium in Europe with 99,354 seats.
                
                The history of FC Barcelona has made it one of the standard bearers of Catalonia and Catalanism, a role underlined by its motto "més que un club" note 2. This does not prevent the club from having supporters throughout the country and even outside of Spain. It feeds a very old and deep rivalry with Real Madrid, the club of the Spanish capital. Their duel, known as el Clásico, regularly decides the outcome of the Spanish championship, in which the two clubs largely dominate the prize list. The two institutions are the only ones, together with Athletic Bilbao, to have participated in all the editions of the Primera División since its creation in 1929.
                
                Since President Laporta's term of office, initiated in 2003, Barça has enjoyed unprecedented sporting success in its history, and has become the most popular club in Europe. Pep Guardiola has had exceptional success in four years, including an unprecedented sixfold increase in 2008-2009 (Spanish Championship, Cup and Super Cup, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup). The club is led by Josep Maria Bartomeu, who succeeds Sandro Rosell on January 23, 20144. For his first season on the bench, coach Luis Enrique won in 2014-2015 the Champions League, the Championship and the Cup.
                
                Coach Ernesto Valverde, for his first season at FC Barcelona in 2017-2018, wins a double Championship-Spanish Cup. It is the 8th double in the history of FC Barcelona. </p>
